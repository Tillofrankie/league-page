  <p>Founded in 2024, The Bachelor’s League began as an 8-man redraft league between close friends, united by competition, trash talk, and a shared obsession with fantasy football. While the laughs were loud and the stakes were low, the hunger for something greater was undeniable.</p>
  <p>By Year 2, the league transformed into what is now known as 4th Down Society—a 10-manager keeper league built on strategy, rivalries, and long-term bragging rights. The buy-in increased, the competition tightened, and the league matured into something far more intense.</p>
  <p>Some managers go all-in to win now, while others play the long game—hoarding youth, building depth, and trusting the process. Friends become rivals every Sunday, and every roster move can make or break a season.</p>
  <p>While managers may come and go, the core remains strong. The group has only grown sharper, funnier, and more competitive—fueled by banter, backstabbing trades, and bold predictions.</p>
  <p>The prize?</p>
  <p>$350 for 1st place. $200 for 2nd. $100 for 3rd. $5 per weekly win.</p>
  <p>And more importantly—a year of superiority in the group chat.</p>
  <p>This isn’t just fantasy football anymore.</p>
  <p>This is 4th Down Society.</p>
  <p>Where champions are made when the pressure is the highest and the decisions are the biggest.</p>
